					<div class="quote">A human being is a part of the whole, called by us the 'Universe', a part limited
						in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings, as something separate from
						the rest - a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison
						for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us.
						Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to
						embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty. Nobody is able to achieve
						this completely, but the striving for such achievement is in itself a part of the liberation and
						a foundation for inner security.</div>

						cruelty therefore, are not so much strong as widespread.&#xA0; But the time must come when
						inhumanity protected by custom and thoughtlessness will succumb before humanity championed by
						thought.&#xA0; Let us work that this time may come</div>

						glass of his knowledge and sees thereby a feather magnified and the whole image in distortion.
						We patronize them for their incompleteness, for their tragic fate for having taken form so far
						below ourselves. And therein do we err. For the animal shall not be measured by man. In a world
						older and more complete than ours, they move finished and complete, gifted with the extension of
						the senses we have lost or never attained, living by voices we shall never hear. They are not
						brethren, they are not underlings: they are other nations, caught with ourselves in the net of
						life and time, fellow prisoners of the splendour and travail of the earth&lt;/h1&gt;</div>
